Dior's first collection launched on February 12th for Spring / Summer 1947 at the company's head quarters. An instant success, Harper's Bazaar Editor-In-Chief Carmel Snow strongly believed in Dior's talent. "It's quite a revolution, dear Christian! Your dresses have such a new look," she exclaimed. Thus, the "New Look" became a trademark. Introducing unique silhouettes consisting of shorter, fuller skirts, tighter waists, and accentuated busts - Dior's pieces were revolutionary, especially in the 40s. "I wanted my dresses to be 'constructed', moulded on the curves of the female body whose contours they would stylish. I accentuated the waist, the volume of the hips, and I emphasized the bust. In order to give my designs more hold, I had nearly all the fabrics lined with percale of taffeta, renewing a tradition that had long been abandoned," said Christian Dior.</p>

padding: 10px 600px 10px 30px;">The start of Chanel Around the age of 18, Coco became interested in fashion. It all really started in 1909. At the time she was the mistress of a businessman named Etienne Balsan, he gave her the financial support she needed to open a hat-making shop in Paris. Another man, one of the wealthier friends of Etienne Balsan, named Arthur Capel, is also known to have had a huge influence on the beginning of the fashion venture of Coco Chanel. Eventually she opened more shops, where she also started making clothes. The House of Chanel was officially born. Coco once told author Paul Morand that her first taste of clothing success came from a dress she fashioned out of an old jersey. Many people asked here where she bought the dress, and her response was the offer to make the same dress for them.</p>
